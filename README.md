## My site

[MichaelHall.io](https://MichaelHall.io)
My personal portfolio site, dedicated to showcase some skills and projects I have created or worked on. Also, I have a blog, to help people learn some tricks and tips, avoid random "gotchas", and most importantly build a quick information guide when I need to relearn something myself.
